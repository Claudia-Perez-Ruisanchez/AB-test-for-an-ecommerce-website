# AB test for an ecommerce website

### Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
For this project, we will be analize the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Our is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

As part of this  project we are going to response questions like:

* Does it appear that country had an impact on conversion?  
* Does the page had an impact on conversion?
* Do the interactions of these factors had an impact of conversion?

## File Description

The dataset that we are going to work with is stored in ab_data.csv. This data set contains 294478 rows with 5 variables, user_id, 	timestamp, group, landing_page  and	converted. We will also work with the dataset countries.csv which stores the country associated to an user_id.
All the codes of our analysis are stored on the Jupyter Notebook Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb.
